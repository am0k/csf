Do the following to get credit:

* Commit the hw6 problems you wrote as hw6-ours.html and the problems you received from the other team as
  hw6-theirs.html in your github repo.
* Commit your work from hw8 as social_network.py, even if you didn't finish.
* Write and submit self-eval and faculty evals for me, Neal, and Sherri online at my.evergreen.edu

Do this by 5pm today (Friday).

Thanks, Paul
