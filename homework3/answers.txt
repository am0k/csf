Homework 3 + Homework 4


Problem 1:
(No answers in this file.)


Problem 2:
GC-content: 0.43029262963


Problem 3:
By commenting out 'seq = ""' and 'linenum = 0', we denied the interpreter a definition (value) for 'linenum', 
without which the program can't run because it would lack a counter.

Commenting out "gc_count = 0" would do the same thing and render the program inoperable. The interpreter can't 
compute a precise answer with unknown variables.


Problem 4:
GC-content: 0.43029262963
AT-content: 0.568993851852


Problem 5:
G count: 11617901
C count: 11617901
A count: 15362834
T count: 15362834


Problem 6:



Problem 7:
AT/GC ratio: 1.01207009747



Problem 8:
GC Classification: Moderate GC Content



Collaboration:

The TA Kahea helped me debug my program for problem 4, I did the rest by myself.


Reflection:

I learned not to be so scared/stressed out about the homework. I stayed up until 7am this morning re-reading 
the assigned readings because I thought my lack of comprehending the text would hinder my ability to finish 
homework 3. It turns out; this was the easiest homework yet.

I didnâ€™t need more resources for this homework.
